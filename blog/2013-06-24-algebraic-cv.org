Browsing through the 2013 [[http://icml.cc/2013/][ICML Atlanta]] papers, I found [[http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/izbicki13.pdf][Algebraic
classifiers: a generic approach to fast cross-validation, online
training, and parallel training]] particularly interesting. Michael
Izbicki shows that if a model can be represented as a monoid, the
runtime of /k/-fold cross-validation can be reduced to $O(k+n)$ from
$O(kn)$. His method is not an approximation either—the results are
exact. I suggest you check out the paper for the details—this
certainly looks really useful. For extra cool points, Michael Izbicki
used Haskell for his implementation.
